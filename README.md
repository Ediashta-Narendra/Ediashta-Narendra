Hi I am Narendra, welcome to my GitHub Profile!


## About Me

I graduated with a degree in International Relations but began exploring my data journey in 2020. During that time, I learned how to build predictive models for time series sales forecasting.

Additionally, I have hands-on experience with data visualization tools such as Tableau and Kibana, as well as database management systems like MongoDB. I am also familiar with ETL-related technologies, including Docker and Elasticsearch, for data processing and deployment.
